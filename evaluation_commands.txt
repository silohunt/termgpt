# Complex Command Evaluation Suite
# Testing CodeLlama output and post-processing effectiveness

# Time-based operations (temporal logic)
1. find log files that were modified in the last 3 days
2. delete backup files older than 30 days
3. compress log files from last week
4. show files created yesterday in the home directory
5. find config files modified within the past hour

# Network and process operations (platform-specific)
6. show which process is using port 8080
7. list all UDP connections on the system
8. find processes consuming more than 50% CPU
9. show network connections from external IPs
10. kill all processes matching nginx

# File operations with complex patterns
11. backup all configuration files excluding temporary ones
12. find duplicate files in the current directory tree
13. compress all log files larger than 100MB from system directories
14. copy all python files to a backup directory preserving structure
15. find files with specific permissions 644 in user directories

# System administration
16. show disk usage of directories larger than 1GB sorted by size
17. monitor system memory usage in real time
18. list all installed packages that were updated last month
19. show system services that failed to start
20. display running processes sorted by memory usage

# Text processing and search
21. find all files containing specific error patterns in log directories
22. extract IP addresses from log files and count occurrences
23. search for TODO comments in all source code files
24. find files with specific content and replace text across multiple files
25. grep for patterns case-insensitively in compressed files

# Clipboard and output operations
26. copy the current directory path to clipboard
27. save system information to a file and copy to clipboard
28. list directory contents and copy to clipboard
